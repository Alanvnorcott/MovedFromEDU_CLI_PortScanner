These two projects are the only C++ projects that I was able to find (stored remotely) unfortunately, most of my other classwork for C++ died with my Macbook during my second and third year.

Software development requires security and performance, particularly for large-scale, high-performance applications. With an emphasis on efficiency, cryptography, and networking—all crucial components of contemporary game development and security—these projects demonstrate my proficiency with C++.

My remote academic background includes only these recoverable C++ projects, but I have more extensive experience with databases, full-stack applications, and backend development. Because C++ is so powerful in game engines and performance-critical applications, I keep learning more about it to hone my problem-solving abilities in intricate systems.
